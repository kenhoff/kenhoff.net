	p.lead CSCI 4830 - Video Game Design and Production - Fall 2012

	:markdown
		[CSCI 4830](http://fragileearthstudios.com/introduction-to-video-game-design-and-production/) was offered Fall 2012, and taught by Julien Lynge of [Fragile Earth Studios](http://fragileearthstudios.com/). It focused on exploration of video game theory and design using [Unity](http://unity3d.com/).

		Our first project focused on Unity basics and was aimed at creating a "scavenger hunt" style game, where players had to find a series of objects while getting feedback of some kind, like a health bar or a progress report indicating how many objects they had collected. Here's the [full list of games](http://fragileearthstudios.com/2012/11/05/student-games-round-1-2/).

		Our game, entitled "Robot Mayhem," put you in control of a spy robot tasked with sneaking past the evil lair's automated security systems. It includes lots of collision triggers, a detection level, lighting and particle systems, respawning, time tracking, and music from Mission Impossible and Team Fortress 2.
