		[CSCI 4830](http://fragileearthstudios.com/introduction-to-video-game-design-and-production/) was offered Fall 2012, and taught by Julien Lynge of [Fragile Earth Studios](http://fragileearthstudios.com/). It focused on exploration of video game theory and design using [Unity](http://unity3d.com/).

		Our second game, entitled "Monster Truck Mayhem" (It was a complete accident that I named them both "Mayhem") is a Tony Hawk-Monster Truck Rally mashup, where players get points for doing awesome tricks in their monster truck. I worked primarily on the physics and controls for the game; for simplicity, I've only included the bits that I've worked on in the web player, but the source code contains the entirety of the project, including the unfinished parts by my project partners.
